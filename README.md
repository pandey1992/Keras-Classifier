# Keras-Classifier
Using Keras classifier to predict if a patient is likely to get diabetes based on various parameters.
We will use Grid Search as well to finetune epoch size, batch size, learn rate and dropout rate.
You could also fine tune initializer and activation function.

Data for this is collected from Kaggle from the below link:
